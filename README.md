Just made this thing to 'learn' JavaScript. Please point out stuff that should be fixed/changed/whatever.

It has been so long since I touched this thing that I forgot exactly what it does what but I'll try my best.

To make it work:
• Put your bots token in config.json,
• Install dependencies (discord.js) in package.json,
• If you want eval to work, get your Discord user ID and put it in the function at the bottom of bot.js
• ????
• Profit!

Things this bot does:
• Creates an x number of teams with a y size (eg. 4 teams of 2),
• I forget what else.

Things this bot doesn't do:
• A lot.
